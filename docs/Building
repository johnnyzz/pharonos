You can try to build everything in your machine but it will probably fail
the first time.
This is because we depend on some libc functions that are diferently
implemented in each iteration of libc. As we rely in the internal parts
the result is that make process breaks any time its files are changed.

Sooo, we created a virtual machine that is used just to compile. That way
everybody has the exact same libs at the time of building, which is nice
and we get away with fixing the makefile.

You first have to share squeak trunk folder to the VM. Then, mount that
dir inside the VM. In VirtualBox:


$> mkdir host
$> sudo mount -t vboxsf squeak-svn ~/host   #mount host's files in guest's filesystem
$> cd host/platforms/squeaknos/
$> sudo bash                    # to be able to write, maybe you don't need this
$> make kernel                  # or make iso or what you want
